 Smart Jhonny has bought a new smart phone and he is analyzing the security features of this phone. The first Security feature he comes across is pattern lock. The lock involves a 3*3 grid numbered as follows:

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

To set the lock, Jhonny must pick an ordering for the nine numbers on the grid and move his fingers from number to number in that order. This leaves behind a trail of lines connecting each number to the next.  For example, if Jhonny chooses the permutation 1 2 3 6 5 4 7 8 9, then he gets the following trail:

1-2-3
        |
4-5-6
 |     
7-8-9
 

The first point Jhonny noted was that there are several possible orderings that can generate the same trail of lines.  This is because, for example, a line from 1 to 3 is indistinguishable from a line from 1 to 2 to 3 or a line from 2 to 1 to 3. Now Jhonny is worried about how secure his password really is. Security of a permutation(P) is defined as the number of permutations(Q), Q â‰  P, that generate the same trail as P. Smart Jhonny is very nervous about security of his password, so you decide to calm him down by writing a program that can compute the security of any password.

Input:
The first line of the input will contain an integer T(<=10^5), specifying the number of test cases. This will be followed by T lines. Each line will contain 9 integers a1, a2, ..., a9. The integers will be from 1 to 9 inclusive and no integer will be repeated (i.e. they will specify an ordering of the numbers 1 to 9).

Output:
Output T lines. Each line should contain a single integer, the number of other orderings that generate the same trail as the corresponding ordering in the input.

Example:
Input:
5
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
1 3 9 7 4 2 6 8 5
5 1 6 4 2 9 8 7 3
3 2 5 8 6 4 7 1 9
4 5 2 8 3 1 6 7 9

Output:
7
1
1
9
1

Explanation:
In the first case, there are 7 other orderings that make the same
trail. They are:
9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
2 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
9 8 7 6 5 4 3 1 2
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 8
8 9 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
2 1 3 4 5 6 7 9 8
8 9 7 6 5 4 3 1 2

In the second case, there is only one other ordering that makes the
same trail:
5 8 6 2 4 7 9 3 1

Warning: Huge I/O. Using printf/scanf in C++ should suffice.
