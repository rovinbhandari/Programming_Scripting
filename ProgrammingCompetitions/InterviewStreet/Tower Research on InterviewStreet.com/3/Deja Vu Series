The "deja vu" series is a non decreasing sequence of positive integers, denoted by DJ(i), for i>=1, and defined such that for every positive integer n, the number of times n appears in the deja vu series is DJ(n). The first few terms of the DJ sequence are listed below.
 
   i       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ..... 
DJ(i)  1 2 2 3 3 4 4 4 5   5  .....
 
Explanation: since DJ(1) is one, 1 appears exactly once in the sequence. Since DJ(2) is two, 2 appears exactly twice in the function. Since DJ(3) is also two, 3 appears exactly twice as well, and 4 appears thrice since DJ(4)=3, so on.
 
Given an integer n, we need to find sum of the sequence DJ(i3) , where 1 <= i <= n.
 
Input:
The first line contains number of test cases T(<=105). Each of the next T lines contains a number n(1 <= n <= 106).
 
Output:
Output exactly T lines, the ith line being the answer of ith query.
 
Sample Input:
5
1
4
2
5
6
 
Sample Output:
1
30
5
54
87

Warning: huge I/O, do not use cin/cout in C++, use scanf/printf instead.

==rb==Time limit is perhaps 1s.
