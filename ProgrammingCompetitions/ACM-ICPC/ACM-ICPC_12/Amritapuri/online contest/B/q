Problem B: Sticks
You have N sticks - the length of the ith stick being L[i]. You also have M 3-dimensional boxes - the length, breadth and height of the jth box being A[j], B[j] and C[j]. What is the maximum number of sticks which can fit in the boxes? A stick can be fit in a box if it can be placed within it without bending or cutting it. A box can hold any number of fitting sicks (assume that the sticks do not intersect each other).
Input (STDIN):
The first line contains the number of test cases T. T test cases follow.
For each test case, the first line contains integers N and M on the first line. The next N lines contain the lengths of each stick, and the M lines after that contain the dimensions of each box denoted by 3 space-separated integers.
There is a blank line after each test case.

Output (STDOUT):
For each test case, output a single integer which is the number of sticks which can fit in the boxes.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 50,000
1 <= M <= 50,000
1 <= L[i] <= 100,000
1 <= A[i],B[i],C[i] <= 30,000
Sample Input:
2
4 2
1
8
4
2
1 2 2
2 3 2

1 1
12
6 8 9
Sample Output:
3
1

Explanation:
For the first test case, the sticks of length 1 and 2 can fit in either of the 2 boxes, while the stick of length 4 can only fit in the second box.
For the second test case, the stick of length 12 can fix in the box of dimensions 6 X 8 X 9.
