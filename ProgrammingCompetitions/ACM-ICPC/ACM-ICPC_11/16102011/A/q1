Problem A: Numerology

Numerology is a difficult branch of magic, involving converting words and names to numbers, and deriving mystical significance from them. Harry Potter, our hero, has never had a good head for maths, being more at home killing evil wizards or playing Quidditch, but his Divination teacher at Hogwarts school of witchcraft has assigned him a numerology project for the Progcon ceremony. She has given him two integers A and B, and has asked him to list all the numbers in the range [A...B] inclusive that contain no digit that occurs more than twice in it, in decimal representation. Harry could not figure out a magic spell to do this task, but you can perhaps help him with your 'compooter thingy' that Muggles* use.

Input (STDIN):
The first line contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T lines contains two integers, A and B.

Output (STDOUT):
Output T lines, one for each case containing the required answer for the corresponding case.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10000
1 <= A <= B <= 10^18

Time limit: 4 seconds

Sample Input:
3
100 120
1000 1000
123 456

Sample Output:
20
0
331

Explanation:
For the first case, all numbers except 111 satisfy the condition.

*Muggles = non-magical people
