Problem B: Count Dracula

Vampires are supposed to enjoy counting so much that in old Europe they would scatter some rice in coffins when they buried people, so that if the corpses came awake at night and became vampires, they would be kept busy until morning counting the grains of rice.

But not all vampires are evil, and the one in the picture has promised to help Harry Potter fight Voldemort, the evil Dark Lord. But instead of learning the magic spells Harry has listed for him, our Count gets distracted and starts to count the letters in the spells.

Can you help the Count count the letters in the spells quickly so that he can move on to actually learning and memorizing the spells?
