<h2>Problem C: Robbing Gringotts</h2>
<h2>
</h2>
The Death Eaters are low on funds, and their leader Voldemort has
asked them to get more money quickly, or face his wrath.&nbsp; They
decide that the best way is to rob Gringotts Wizarding Bank.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
By threatening one of the goblins in charge of the bank, the 'M' Death
Eaters have discovered that Gringotts has 'N' vaults, with vault
number 'i' containing&nbsp; X[i] gold items.&nbsp; The weights of the
gold items in the ith vault are g[i][1],g[i][2],...,g[i][X[i]]. But as soon as
a vault is robbed, the magical wards go off and alarm bells ring. Thus they
have enough time to rob just one vault each, and all robberies have to take
place at the same time. The Death Eaters have decided that no two of
them will rob the same vault as this increases the chances of them
being caught.<br>
<br>
Death Eater j has a bag which can hold weight v[j]. They are a greedy
and cowardly lot, so a Death Eater will only agree to rob a vault if he
can fill up his bag completely to its capacity by taking some subset of
the objects present in that vault. Note that it is not possible for a Death
Eater to break any gold item; either it should be taken fully, or not be
taken.<br>
<br>
Find the maximum weight of gold they can take away by planning their
strategy correctly. <img style="width: 294px; height: 193px;"

<h3>Input (STDIN):</h3>
The first line contains the number of test cases T. T test cases
follow. Each test case contains integers M and N on the first line. The
next line contains M integers, the jth of which is v[j], which is the
maximum weight of gold the jth Death Eater's bag can hold. The
following N lines describe the gold items in the vaults. The ith line
contains X[i], the number of gold items present in the ith vault,
followed by X[i] integers g[i][1]..g[i][X[i]], denoting the weights of
the each of the items present in the ith vault. There is a blank line
after each test case.<br>
<br>
<h3>Output (STDOUT):</h3>
Output one line for each test case, containing the maximum total weight of
gold that the Death Eaters can rob.<br>
