<h2>Problem E: Distinct Primes<br>
</h2>
Arithmancy is Draco Malfoy's favorite subject, but what spoils it for
him is that Hermione Granger is in his class, and she is better than
him at it.&nbsp; Prime numbers are of mystical importance in
Arithmancy, and Lucky Numbers even more so. Lucky Numbers are those
positive integers that have at least three distinct prime factors; 30
and 42 are the first two.
Malfoy's teacher has given them a positive integer <i>n, </i>and
has asked them to find the <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>th lucky number. Malfoy would like to beat Hermione at this
exercise, so although
he is an evil git, please help him, just this once<i>. &nbsp;</i>After all, the know-it-all Hermione does need a lesson.<i><br>
