<h2>Problem A: MAGRID</h2>
<p align="justify">
Thanks a lot for helping Harry Potter in finding the Sorcerer's Stone
of Immortality in October. Did we not tell you that
it was just an online game ? uhhh! now here is the real onsite task for
Harry. You are given a magrid S ( a magic grid ) having R rows and C
columns. Each cell in this magrid has either a Hungarian horntail
dragon that our intrepid hero has to defeat, or a flask of magic
potion that his teacher Snape has left for him. A dragon at a cell
(i,j) takes away |S[i][j]| strength points from him, and a potion
at a cell (i,j) increases Harry's strength by S[i][j]. If his strength
drops to 0 or less at any point during his journey, Harry dies, and
no magical stone can revive him. </p>
<p align="justify">
Harry starts from the top-left corner cell (1,1) and the Sorcerer's
Stone is in the bottom-right corner cell (R,C). From a cell (i,j),
Harry can only move either one cell down or right i.e., to cell (i+1,j)
or cell (i,j+1) and he can not move
outside the magrid. Harry has used magic before starting his journey to
determine which cell contains what, but lacks the basic
simple mathematical skill to determine what minimum strength he needs
to start with to collect the Sorcerer's Stone. Please help him once
again.</p>
<h3>Input (STDIN):</h3>
<p align="justify">
The first line contains the number of test cases T. T cases follow.
Each test case consists of R C in the first line followed by the
description of the grid in R lines, each containing C integers. Rows
are numbered 1 to R from top to bottom and columns are numbered
1 to C from left to right. Cells with S[i][j] &lt; 0 contain dragons,
others contain magic potions.</p>
<h3>Output (STDOUT):</h3>
<p align="justify">
Output T lines, one for each case containing the minimum strength Harry
should start with from the cell (1,1) to have a positive strength
through out his journey to the cell (R,C). </p>
<h3>Constraints:</h3>

<h3>Sample Output:</h3>

</span><br>
<h3>Explanation:</h3>
Case 1 : If Harry starts with strength = 1 at cell (1,1), he cannot
maintain a positive strength in any possible path. He needs at least
strength = 2 initially.<br>
Case 2 : Note that to start from (1,1) he needs at least strength = 1.<br>
