/*	
	The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first 		ten terms would be:

	1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

	Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

	 1: 1
	 3: 1,3
	 6: 1,2,3,6
	10: 1,2,5,10
	15: 1,3,5,15
	21: 1,3,7,21
	28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
	We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.
	
	What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?
