<h2>Problem F: Magical Bridges<br>
</h2>
<p align="justify">
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry has a circular lane having N
towers numbered 1 to <b>N</b>. Towers <i>i</i> and <i>i</i>+1 are
adjacent to each other for 1 &#8804; <i>i</i>
&lt; N and also towers 1 and N are adjacent to each other. Each of
these towers has exactly <b>F</b> number of floors, numbered
1,2,3,..,F-1,F from bottom to top. Floors <i>i</i> and <i>i</i>+1 in
a tower are adjacent to each other and it takes one second to move
between them. It also takes one second to move between floor 1 of a
tower and floor 1 of its adjacent tower.
Apart from these, there are <b>M</b> bridges designed for a quick
escape in case of a Death Eater attack, each of which connects two
floors of different towers. Each of these bridges is given as <i>bi fi
bj fj t</i>, meaning it takes <i>t</i> seconds to move along this
bridge that connects the floor <i>fi</i> of tower <i>bi</i> and
the floor <i>fj</i> of tower <i>bj</i>. All ways are bidirectional.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Given <i>(qbi,qfi)</i> and <i>(qbj,qfj)</i>, find the minimum time in
seconds it takes to reach floor qfj of tower qbj, starting from floor qfi
of tower qbi. You have to answer a lot of such queries.</p>
<h3>Input (STDIN):</h3>
<p align="justify">
The first line contains the number of test cases T. T cases follow.
Each test case consists of N F M in the first line. N is the number of
towers, F is the number of floors in each tower and M is the number of
bridges. M lines follow, each of the form <i>bi fi bj fj t</i>, as
mentioned in the
problem statement. Next line contains Q, the number of queries and Q
lines follow, each of the form <i>qbi qfi qbj qfj.</i></p>
<h3>Output (STDOUT):</h3>
<p align="justify">
For each query of the form <i>qbi qfi qbj qfj</i>, output one line
denoting the minimum time in seconds it takes to reach the floor <i>qfj</i>
of tower <i>qbj</i>,
starting from the floor <i>qfi</i> of tower <i>qbi.</i></p>
