<h2>Problem H: Array Diversity<br>
</h2>
Enough with this Harry Potter, please! What are we, twelve-year
olds?&nbsp; Let's get our teeth into some real pumpkin pasties -- oops,
programming problems!<br>
<br>
Here we go!<br>
Let's define the diversity of a list of numbers to be the difference
between the largest and smallest number in the list.<br>
For example, the diversity of the list (1, -1, 2, 7) = 7 - (-1) = 8.<br>
<br>
A substring of a list is considered a non-empty sequence of contiguous
numbers from the list. For example, for the list (1,3,7), the
substrings are (1), (3), (7), (1,3), (3,7), (1,3,7). A subsequence of a
list is defined to be a non-empty sequence of numbers obtained by deleting
some elements from the list. For example, for the list (1,3,7), the
subsequences are (1), (3), (7), (1,3), (3,7), (1,7), (1,3,7).<br>
<br>
Given a list of length N find the number of substrings and subsequences
in this list with the maximum diversity. If a substring/subsequence
having maximum diversity occurs multiple times in the list, each of its
occurances adds towards the answer. &nbsp; And tell Harry Potter
your answer.<br>
<h3>Input (STDIN):</h3>
The first line contains T, the number of test cases. Then follow T test
case blocks.<br>
Each blocks starts with the first line containing the number N.<br>
The second line contains a list of numbers in this list.<br>
<h3>Output (STDOUT):</h3>
For each test case, output the number of substrings and the number of
subsequences in this list with the maximum diversity.<br>
Since the answers maybe very large, output them modulo 1000000007.<br>
<h3>Constraints:</h3>
T &lt;= 10<br>
N &lt;= 100,000<br>
Each number in the list is between 1 and 100,000 inclusive.<br>
Time Limit: 2 s<br>
Memory Limit: 32 MB<br>
<h3>Sample Input:</h3>
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">3<br>
3<br>
1 2 3<br>
4<br>
1 4 3 4<br>
3<br>
3 2 1<br>
</span><br>
<h3>Sample Output:</h3>
<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">1 2<br>
3 6<br>
1 2<br>
