StoChart : **Stoc**k Price **Chart**s in Local Currency
=======================================================

Description
-----------

Mini-project to get historical and current overview of stock-price of a company in a currency other than the one the stock is traded in so as to be able to visually identify good minima/maxima to trade the stock. The aim is to visualize how both stock-price and currency conversion fluctuations affect the overall stock price in a different currency. In this mini-project, the stock chosen is MSFT (which is normally traded in USD) and the currency chosen is NOK.
