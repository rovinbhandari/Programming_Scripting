In a school in 'The land of Nowhere', students love to be the goalkeeper while playing soccer. Coach Randy has designed a method to pick a goal keeper among a givenset of students. He asks them to first stand in a line and assigns them numbers. So, the first in line is given 1, the second is given 2 and so on. Now, he asks them to form a circle. Then, he starts eliminating 'alternate' students starting from 2 (remember, its a circle; so this elimination would occur over and over) . This process continues until only one student is left, who then becomes the goalkeeper. He thinks this is a fair method, but can you do the math to beat his idea ?
