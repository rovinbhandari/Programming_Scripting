The n^(th) term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, t_(n) = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t_(10). If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.
